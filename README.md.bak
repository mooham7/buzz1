# The Dark Side of the Keto Diet:Long-Term Consequences You Might not Expect


The ketogenic diet (or keto diet) has enjoyed growing popularity over the last several years, but it may not be all that it’s cracked up to be. In fact, studies suggest that following this extremely low-carb diet may lead to some pretty unpleasant long-term consequences. This article lists a few of the known downsides associated with going on the keto diet, so you can make an educated decision before jumping on board.

What is Ketosis?
When your body is in a state of ketosis (or keto), it’s breaking down fats and sugars to generate energy—instead of carbohydrates, like glucose. As a result, all that unused glucose gets converted into something called ketones instead. It’s like getting rid of all those unused muffins by burning them for energy! So what exactly is ketosis? In short, it’s when your body burns fat rather than carbohydrates as its primary source of fuel. Your liver converts fatty acids into two compounds called ketone bodies, which are used as an alternative source of energy by some cells in your body, especially your brain. Ketogenic diets aim to replicate that process—forgoing carbs (and sometimes calories) entirely or mostly and relying on fats as fuel.

How is Ketosis Different From Atkins?
At its core, ketosis is similar to Atkins. The Atkins diet restricts carbohydrates in favor of fats, proteins and non-starchy vegetables. On keto, those macronutrient proportions are flipped—the majority of calories come from fat and protein with very little from carbs. Whereas some people can be in and out of ketosis on a low carb diet without experiencing any negative side effects; others might struggle more when following a low carb or high fat diet because their bodies may process these foods differently. If you’re new to low carb/keto eating, it’s a good idea to check with your doctor before going all in on these diets.

Understanding Carbohydrates
One gram of carbohydrates yields four calories, but it doesn’t mean that all carbs are created equal. Refined carbohydrates like flour and sugar can cause sharp spikes in your blood glucose levels which, if they continue unabated, will lead to insulin resistance. A diet high in refined carbs increases your risk for chronic disease by increasing inflammation and oxidative stress, according to a review published in Current Cardiology Reports. Eating fewer refined carbs and more fiber can help reduce weight gain, improve satiety during weight loss and protect you against diabetes long term.

What Happens to Your Body When You’re On A Low-Carb Diet?
A ketogenic diet forces your body to turn to fat for fuel. This is a survival mechanism that helped humans survive periods of famine and was also essential for early development. But, in our modern times, it’s risky; many studies have pointed out how being on a low-carb diet can increase your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. In short, you might lose weight, but at what cost?

Protein and Amino Acids
When you eat a keto diet that’s high in protein, your brain converts a lot of these extra amino acids into glucose via a process called gluconeogenesis (for more on gluconeogenesis, click here). That glucose can become very toxic and it’s thought to play a role in neurodegeneration. In fact, several studies have shown that restricting carb intake lowers oxidative stress and makes your brain healthier. [9] [10] [11] It doesn’t take long for keto die-hards to get mad about these findings because they contradict conventional wisdom—which states that carbs are bad for you.

Fats and Omegas
There are several different kinds of fats you’ll encounter on a keto diet. One type, saturated fat, is generally known as bad fat, though it has an important role in many bodily functions. Saturated fats are a healthy part of any well-formulated keto diet. In fact, they should make up about 80 to 90 percent of your total fat intake. A second type is unsaturated fat, which includes both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are typically healthier for your heart. Some nuts, seeds and certain oils are especially rich in these two molecules.

Intermittent Fasting and Leptin
Leptin plays a major role in regulating metabolism and hunger. It also affects sleep, memory, mood and other functions. People who are overweight often have high levels of leptin because their body is storing excess fat; however, being too thin can cause leptin levels to drop. This makes people prone to overeat because they want more food but don’t feel hungry enough to eat it. People practicing intermittent fasting may be at risk for lower leptin levels because they are not eating as much as their body expects them to.

Where Does Ketosis Fit In?
Ketosis can be great for energy levels, weight management and mental focus. If you’re well adapted to a ketogenic diet, then it will likely help your blood sugar levels stay within a healthy range while also helping you to maintain lean muscle mass and beneficial fat stores. But if you’re new to ketosis or just jumping on board to get in shape, then there are some long-term consequences that you might want to consider before deciding if it’s right for you. Make sure that you take all of these into consideration before starting a ketogenic diet plan; failing to do so could have serious consequences down the line.

What Are the Long-Term Effects of Following a Keto Diet?
A ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with fasting. It involves dramatically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat (which turns into ketones) while also reducing caloric intake. There are many variations of such a diet, but all have in common restricting carbohydrates or calorie consumption to some degree. Although a vast amount of research has been conducted on fasts lasting less than 24 hours, very little is known about their long term effects on health other than they cause weight loss.

So, you might be wondering if there are any long-term consequences to following a keto diet. The honest answer is that we really don’t know. Short term, some evidence has shown that you can experience improved focus and reduced appetite, making it easier to stick to a weight loss plan. Long term, we simply do not know enough about following a ketogenic diet for months or years to say for certain what those long-term impacts will be on your brain health or lifespan (yes, studies have been conducted in mice and rats—but what happens when one puts a mouse on keto? We just don’t know yet). Not only that but many people follow ketogenic diets just because they want quick results—and as quickly as possible!
